# Javascript Boilerplate

My own JS boilerplate.  Started with create-react-app, decided I only needed pieces of the project.

## Desired Features

* Babel ES6+/JSX transpiling
* For react, need a module bundler, so webpack, gulp no longer necessary
* Hot module reloading (for CSS/all components)
* 


#### Preferences

* Use `.babelrc` file instead of inside `package.json`.  







## Running


First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.




## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.



#### Influences

This project influenced by `create-react-app`, `react-boilerplate`, Wes Bos' courses, and Cory House's JavaScript environment setup on Pluralsight.
